## About

SMEIH is a web platform designed to serve as an intermediary between international and local investors both private and government with individual or group wanting to start a small medium  enterprise. We carefully put into consideration possible security hassles that would reduce the integrity of the platform. The platform features an admin, Investors, Business owners and agent platform. The app is featuring blockchain technology to handle the security of transactions(cash flow) in the system

The project is created using node js backend server and react frontend framework.

## Why

SMEs are crucial contributor to the economy of any nation, contributing up 60% of the total employment. However 200 million SMEs lack access to affordable financial services and credit. When firms gain access to financial services such as credit and insurance, they can accumulate assets, expand their firms, make more productive investments and create jobs.

## Usage

If this project sounds interesting to you and you'd like to contribute, thank you!
First, you can send a mail to buildforsdg@andela.com to indicate your interest, why you'd like to support and what forms of support you can bring to the table, but here are areas we think we'd need the most help in this project :
1.  area one (e.g this app is about human trafficking and you need feedback on your roadmap and feature list from the private sector / NGOs)
2.  area two (e.g you want people to opt-in and try using your staging app at staging.project-name.com and report any bugs via a form)
3.  area three (e.g here is the zoom link to our end-of sprint webinar, join and provide feedback as a stakeholder if you can)
